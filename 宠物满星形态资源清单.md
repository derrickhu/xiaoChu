# 满星（★3）形态 — 宠物头像资源清单（100只）

## 满星形态画风说明

**设计目标**：宠物升至★3满星后解锁全新头像，画风从原版Q版卡通**升级为水墨国风**，与游戏整体UI的水墨画风高度统一，同时保留角色辨识度。满星形态是对原版形象的"蜕变升华"，更精致、更有仙侠气韵。

**画风参考**：**中国传统水墨画 + 工笔重彩** — 类似阴阳师式纸、剑网3水墨CG、山海经古籍插画的风格。保留大头Q版比例（头身比约2:1~3:1），但笔触从纯色平涂改为**水墨晕染质感**，线条从粗黑卡通描边改为**流畅的毛笔墨线描边**。整体呈现"水墨宣纸上的仙灵"感觉，融入更浓郁的**中国仙侠神话**美学。

**与原版的核心区别**：
- **线条**：原版=粗均匀黑色卡通描边 → 满星=毛笔书法式墨线，有粗细变化、起收笔锋
- **填色**：原版=纯色平涂色块 → 满星=水墨晕染质感，允许同色系内的淡墨渐晕（非光影渐变）
- **细节量**：原版=简洁概括 → 满星=更丰富的装饰（更多饰品、花纹、灵纹、祥云等）
- **动态感**：原版=静态正面头像 → 满星=允许微动态（侧头、回眸、咆哮、施法等姿态）
- **气韵**：原版=Q萌可爱 → 满星=仙气飘逸 / 威严霸气（根据角色性格）

**构图规范**：1:1正方形头像，**大头 + 肩部**（Q版大头比例，头部占画面65%以上），纯色背景，允许比原版多露出一点肩部/上身以展示更多装饰细节。

**配色原则**：
- 保留原版角色的核心配色识别（如赤焰火狐仍以橙红为主），但色调整体偏向**水墨雅致**
- 允许使用墨色浓淡变化、朱砂红、石青蓝、石绿、赭石黄等**中国传统矿物颜料色**
- 属性元素通过更精致的**灵纹、法阵光环、仙灵饰品**等细节体现
- 满星角色可增加**金色/仙光点缀**（如金色灵纹、金色瞳孔光环）表达满星尊贵感

**抠图友好约束（重要）**：
- **必须有清晰的黑色墨线描边轮廓**（毛笔风格，有粗细变化），描边外侧**不得有白色描边或任何颜色溢出**
- **禁止描边外的白色勾边/白色光晕/白色轮廓线** — 黑色描边即为最外层，描边之外直接是背景
- 禁止使用模糊特效、辉光/发光特效、光晕、柔光等导致边缘模糊的效果
- 禁止半透明、羽化边缘、光芒扩散、写实光影等超出角色轮廓描边的视觉效果
- 背景必须为**纯色（solid color）或透明背景**
- 角色边缘必须干净锐利，确保可以轻松抠图

**通用 Prompt 前缀**（所有满星头像共用）：
```
